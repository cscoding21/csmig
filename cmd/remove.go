	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	//removeCmd.PersistentFlags().String("name", "", "The name of the migration to remove.  The name does not include the file extension.")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	removeCmd.Flags().StringP("name", "n", "", "The name of the migration to remove.  The name does not include the file extension.")
